# Chime - Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* Chime

* Founded in 2013

* Founders: Chris Britt and Ryan King

* The founders focused on a new approach to banking that didn't rely on bank fees or profit from customer's financial mistakes, such as overdraft fees and monthly fees.  Instead, focusing on developing revenue from card interchange revenue.

* Chime initially started with Seed funding by three investors for a total of $3.8M raised in August 2013.  To date, Chime has raised over $2.6B in funding as of August 2021.  Most recently, Chime has been valuated at $25B as of 2021.  


## Business Activities:

* As noted in the overview, Chime tries to make banking simpler for customers by providing a different approach by removing pitfalls tied to traditional banking. By providing a service that eliminates monthly and overdraft fees, Chime provides a service helping customers be better financially.  Chime is also FDIC insured through The Bancorp Bank or Stride Bank, which garners the trust needed to be a digital bank and builds confidence for customers.
  
* Chime initially targeted a younger demographic.  They focused on people-first approach and tech driven individuals who were looking for a different way of banking without the hidden fees. Chime is now considered to be one of the largest and most popular neobanks in the United States. Currently, Chime has over 13 million active users.  

* What Chime does well is offer an application that works well and works fast.  Besides the benefits of a lack of fees, Chime offers the ability to customers to send and receive money quickly and safely.  While Chime has many competitors in the digital banking domain, they vary themselves by the constant addition of features to its services and application.  Some examples include the Credit Builder Visa Credit Card, Automatic Savings and various alerts/notifications via the application.

* Chime utilizes the following technologies:
    * Languages: JavaScript, Ruby, Go, Elixir
    * Amazon Cloud, Big Data, Database Services: (S3, EC2, Aurora, Athena, AWS, RDS)
    * Application Development: React Native, Rails
    * Cloud Computing: Snowflake
    * Database Management System: Galileo, Postgres, Citus
    * Utilities for analytics: Plaid, Google Analytics, Twilio, Optimizely, Segment, Looker

## Landscape:

* Fintech Domain: Personal Finance/Deposits/Online Banking

* Online banking offers various advantages to traditional banks such as lower fees, better interest rates, accessibility, but also offers traditional benefits (ATM access and security).  Chime is considered a neobank.  Neobanks only offer services remotely and do not have a physical brick and mortar location. 

    * Neobanks have seen a major surgence in the past 5 years with evolution of the current financial climate, evolution of technology and Covid-19.  The need to access finances remotely without having to go to a physical location or visit an ATM has propelled online banking.
    * Currently, the majority of neobanks including Chime only focus on national markets and not internationally.  Neobanks also continue to offer more services such as credit cards and savings accounts. Another trend neobanks are beginning to utilize is managing finances via messenger service without having to use the application.

* Top neobanks in the space include:

    * Chime, Acorns, Current, Revolut, N26, Statrys, Monzo, Current, Starling Bank, Atom Bank


## Results

* Chime has had major impact online banking.  The company has seen major growth since its inception in 2013.  According to BusinessofApps, in 2017 Chime had 500,000 users and in 2021 Chime has 13 million users.  This exponential growth in just a 4 year timeframe shows the trend of people looking to open neobank accounts.  The reach of neobanks let them reach different customer bases that traditional banks can not reach, such as migrant workers. 

* Chime is also slated to go public as an IPO in March 2022.  According to Forbes, in the latest valuation, Chime has become more valuable than some regional banks, Fifth Third, M&T and Regions.  Chime is slated to generate $900M to $1B in 2021.  

* Two key metrics Chime uses to verify is company success include: generated revenue and total active users.  As seen in the following metrics (from 2018 -2021), Chime continues to be successful with continuous growth.
    
    * Revenue: 2018 - $80 million, 2019 - $200 million, 2020 - $600 million, estimated 2021 - $1 billion
    * Users: 2018 - 1 million, 2019 - 5 million, 2020 - 10 million, 2021 - 13 million

* Chime continues to be one of the most popular neobanks in the space today.  According to BusinessofApps, other competitors' user bases are well below the Chime with Acorns (8 million) and Current (3 million) coming in second and third respectivily.

## Recommendations

* Even though Chime continues to see exponential growth, they also have met some struggles along the way.  Most recently, there has been criticism towards Chime's customer service especially pertaining to the locking of users accounts without warning.  According to complaints via the Better Business Bureau as of July of 2021, Chime had received over 920 complaints with 197 of those regarding account closures against the customer's will.  

* Another issue Chime has had to deal with was an application outage leaving millions of customers without access to their accounts back in October 2019.  This was the third outage in less 6 months.  The issue was primarily through the payment database processor Galileo, which Chime utilizes to bridge Chime to credit card payments.  The issue appears to have been resolved with Galileo.  To help alleviate unforseen outages Chime needs to step up its customer service and respond to its customer's needs to help resolve the issue.  The issue was resolved, but issues like this if not handled properly could have cost Chime customers in the short and long term.

* These types of issues can influence the company's future growth potential if not handled appropriately.  The outlook of Chime is great and if managed correctly can continue to grow and expand.  My recommendation to the company would be to focus on the following topics: Customer Service Enhancement and Accessibility to Varied Currency



### Customer Service Enhancements

* Currently, Chime utilizes Chatbots, live agents via telephone and FAQ's for customer service.  At present, this is sufficient as it provides various options for customers to access.  Improvements can always make this process better.  What traditional banks do well is that they can offer the person to person experience.  Not all customers or potential customers want a simple chat to resolve a problem or answer a question.  

    If Chime can utilize technology for video conference such as Amazon Chime or Zoom they can build that relationship and trust.  Customers can feel they are not just speaking to a random customer service representative via chat or on the phone.  Building that trust with customers can yield positive reviews and be marketable to potential customers who may be wary in placing their money in a non-traditonal bank.

### Accessibility to Varied Currency

* Currently, Chime is only available in the United States.  To expand, Chime should look to get into international and cryptocurrency markets.  Yes, you can use your Chime card to pay internationally, but you can only open an account in the United States.  It would only be natural to expand its base internationally to increase its customer base.  

    More importantly, the acceptance of cryptocurrency can make Chime a one-stop shop to deal with a customer's wealth.  Cryptocurrency is currently housed on digital wallets and Chime in many regards is another digital wallet.  It only makes sense to marry the pair.  There are obvious concerns with housing cryptocurrency digitally only especially with security.  To alleviate this, Chime should partner with third party cold storage wallets.  A cold storage wallet option would be a secure solution as it is not connected to the internet.  Cold storage wallets like Ledger or Arculus can be a great solution and addition to Chime.  This would just add to Chime's available services, which can make the application more robust.
